It's still used today for most media (eg. newspapers, textbooks) and in universities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beyond this, each country has its own dialect (or slang) version of Arabic. This includes both use of vocabulary, and also actual grammar (or ignoring the classical grammar).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While some of the sample questions on Area 51 talk about Arabic in a specific area, the question is really how we should plan and organize questions, or whether we should focus exclusively on classical Arabic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="20" LastEditorUserId="20" LastEditDate="2015-07-14T22:27:41.087" LastActivityDate="2015-07-15T16:43:23.787" Title="Which Arabic are we talking about?"
